We created Flipp Tickets as a response to the predatory secondary ticket exchange market in which monopolizing centralized platforms like Ticketmaster are able to charge users 20%+ in fees. By harnessing the security of the blockchain we aim to provide event goers a payment platform system to allow the P2P economy to flourish.
